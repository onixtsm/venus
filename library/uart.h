/**
 * @defgroup UART UART library
 *
 * @brief Functions to use the Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter
 * (UART).
 *
 * Two UART channels can be instantiated, UART0 and UART1.
 * Before sending and receiving bytes the UART must be connect to some I/O pins
 * through the switchbox, e.g.
 * @code
 * switchbox_set_pin(IO_AR0, SWB_UART0_RX);
 * switchbox_set_pin(IO_AR1, SWB_UART0_TX);
 * @endcode
 *
 * After that, an example of how to use this library for the MASTER.
 * @code
 * #include <libpynq.h>
 * int main (void)
 * {
 *  // initialise all I/O
 *  pynq_init();
 *
 *  // initialize UART 0
 *  uart_init(UART0);
 *  // flush FIFOs of UART 0
 *  uart_reset_fifos(UART0);
 *
 *  uint8_t byte[] = "Hello\n";
 *  int i = 0;
 *  while (byte[i] != '\0') {
 *   uart_send (UART0, byte[i]);
 *   printf("sent byte %d\n", byte[i]);
 *   i++;
 *  }
 *
 *   // clean up after use
 *   pynq_destroy();
 *   return EXIT_SUCCESS;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * An example of how to use this library for the SLAVE.
 * @code
 * #include <libpynq.h>
 * int main (void)
 * {
 *  // initialise all I/O
 *  pynq_init();
 *
 *  // initialize UART channel 0
 *  uart_init(UART0);
 *  // flush FIFOs of UART 0
 *  uart_reset_fifos (UART0);
 *
 *  printf("listening\n");
 *  do {
 *    // get a byte from UART 0
 *    uint8_t msg = uart_recv(UART0);
 *    printf("received byte %d\n", msg);
 *  } while (1);
 *
 *   // clean up after use
 *   pynq_destroy();
 *   return EXIT_SUCCESS;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * UARTs can be routed through the switch box (see switchbox.h). Note that
 * switchbox numbering (SWB_UART0..SWB_UART1) is then used instead of
 * 0..NUM_UARTS-1 (UART0..UART1).
