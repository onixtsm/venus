/**
 * @defgroup SWITCHBOX I/O Switchbox library
 *
 * @brief The switchbox enables run-time (re)mapping of I/O pins.
 *
 * For example, the transmit output of UART 0 (SWB_UART0_TX) can be mapped to
 * analog pins IO_AR0 & IO_AR1. Or the output of PWM 0 (SWB_PWM0) can be mapped
 * to green LED 0 (pin IO_LD0). Or the output of PWM 0 (pin SWB_PWM0) can be
 * mapped to the green component of color LED 0 (pin IOB_LD0).
 *
 * @warning Switchbox functions (dis)connect IO pins (outside world) to FPGA
 * hardware (on the Zynq 7020).  IO pins are named IO_* (e.g. IO_LD0) and are of
 * type io_t defined in pinmap.h. The FPGA hardware is named SWB_* (e.g.
 * SWB_UART0) of type (io_configuration_t) defined in switchbox.h.
 *
 * @code
 * #include<pinmap.h>
 * #include<switchbox.h>
 *
 * int main (void)
 * {
 *   pynq_init();
 *   switchbox_init();
 *   // connect pin A0 to UART0's TX pin
 *   switchbox_set_pin(IO_AR0, SWB_UART0_TX);
 *   // also see examples in gpio.h
 *   switchbox_destroy();
 *   pynq_destroy();
 * }
