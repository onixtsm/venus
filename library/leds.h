/**
 * @defgroup LEDS LED library
 *
 * @brief Wrappers to simplify the use of LEDs.
 *
 * - Green LEDs are numbered 0 to NUM_GREEN_LEDS-1.
 * - Only color LED 0 is used.
 * - The color LED has three components R, G, B that can be set independently to
 * mix to a color.
 *
 * LEDs can be used in three modes:
 *
 * 1. on/off mode for all green LEDs and all color LEDs
 * 2. PWM mode for green LEDs (PWM0..PWM3 are rounted to green LEDs 0..3)
 * 3. PWM mode for color LED 0 (PWM0..PWM3 are routed to color LED 0)
 *
 * An example of how to use this library.
 * @code
 * #include <libpynq.h>
 * int main (void)
 * {
 *   // initialise all I/O
 *   gpio_reset();
 *   leds_init_onoff();
 *
 *   for (int led = 0; led < NUM_GREEN_LEDS; led++)
 *     green_led_on(led);
 *   sleep_msec(500);
 *   for (int led = 0; led < NUM_GREEN_LEDS; led++)
 *     green_led_off(led);
 *
 *   // clean up after use
 *   leds_destroy(); // switches all leds off
 *   pynq_destroy();
 *   return EXIT_SUCCESS;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * LEDs can also be used through GPIO (see gpio.h and pinmap.h). Note that GPIO
 * numbering (IO_LD0..IO_LD3) is then used instead of 0..NUM_GREEN_LEDS-1
 * (LED0..LED3). In the PWM mode for color LED 0, SWB_PWM0..SWB_PWM3
 * are routed to color LED 0 (GPIO IO_LD4R, IO_LD4G, IO_LD4B).
